# Class-Work---Web-Programming-


Hello, my name is Christian Collado, and I am a Computer Science major with some experience in coding. I've taken java courses, css and now html, I am excited to learn more about these languages and master the art of web programming. An interesting project I've done was during my sophomore year which was my first introduction to java and by the end of the course we made a game. As for other projects, they were from other classes I've taken at New Paltz, and had to do in java and C++ code.

By the end of this course, I will see myself making websites for other people or companies as a side hustle and possibly make it a job by the end of my college career like web management and degugging bugs or fixing code. Learning more html and css can help advance my knowledge with databases and web designing. I've always wondered what work it took to design websites and the vast amount of language profficiency it requires to make proficiency done websites.
